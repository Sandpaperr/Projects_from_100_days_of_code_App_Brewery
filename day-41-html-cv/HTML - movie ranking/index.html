        <h1>THE BEST MOVIES BY SANDPAPERR</h1>
        <h2>My top 4 movies of all time</h2>
        <hr>
        <h3>Constantine</h3>
        <p>This must be the movie that I rewatched the most in my entire life</p>

        <p>I love how technology and nature fuse in the movie. Also the concept of enery and connection to the planet is huge and it's soo visual. I would love that to be in real life too, to feel and see the connection through lights and waves</p>

        <h3>Dragon Trainer</h3>
        <p>What I loved about it is the conncection between people and dragons, how once mastered, it allows people to fly and feel free, protected and vulnerable at the same time</p>

        <h3>300</h3>
        <p>well, this it THE movie everyone should watch. It's a masterpiece of rawness and manhood, it's a statement of strength and that everything is possible with hard work and risks and that you achieve the impossible when you are either get it or die trying</p>
