# 100 days of code by App Brewery
In this repository you can find projects from the course "100 days of code" by App Brewery. The course focuse on creating a Python project for each day so that at the end the partecipant will have 100 projects to showcase. Most of the projects start with some code skeleton made by App Brewery and the partecipant need to complete them or expand. 

This repository contains all the projects that I am working on or that are considere completed by the Course criteria.
Any project that I expanded and modified has been modved to its own repository. Any project that started from the "100 days of code" is mentioned either in the first lines of main.py or in a related redme file.
